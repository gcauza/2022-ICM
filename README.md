# Carbon Sequestration Modeling in National Forests

This repository contains the documentation for a project submitted to the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). I developed a model to calculate and predict changes in carbon sequestration over a period of 100+ years, applied specifically to National Forests to determine the optimal peak harvest time.

## Features
- **Carbon Sequestration Estimation**: Calculates the average current amount of carbon sequestration in a forest.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Estimates carbon sequestration over significant periods, aiding in long-term planning.
- **Decision Support for Forest Managers**: Provides a decision model to help forest managers meet sustainability goals by weighing influential factors.
- **Case Study Application**: Applied the models to Cedarville State Forest, evaluating a management plan from 2016 to 2116.
